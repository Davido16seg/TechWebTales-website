        <h2>Common Internet Protocols</h2>
        <p>Internet Protocols ref:</p>
        <p>Border Gateway Protocol:</p>
        <p>BGP makes the internet work. This routing protocol controls how packets pass through routers in an autonomous system (AS) – one or multiple networks run by a single organization or provider – and connect to different networks.</p>
        <p>Domain name system:</p>
        <p>DNS is a database that includes a website’s domain name, which people use to access the website, and its corresponding IP addresses, which devices use to locate the website.</p>
        <p>File Transfer Protocol:</p>
        <p>FTP is a client-server protocol, with which a client requests a file, and the server supplies it. FTP runs over TCP/IP, which is explained on the 11th point below.</p>
        <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol:</p>
        <p>Like FTP, HTTP is a file sharing protocol that runs over TCP/IP, although HTTP primarily works over web browsers and is commonly recognizable for most users.</p>
        <p>Internet Protocol:</p>
        <p>IP functions similarly to a postal service. When users send and receive data from their device, the data gets spliced into packets, which are like letters with two IP addresses: one for the sender and one for the receiver. Packets travel through gateways until they reach their destinations.</p>
        <p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol:</p>
        <p>SMTP is the most popular email protocol, is part of the TCP/IP suite and controls how email clients send users’ email messages.</p>
        <p>Telnet:</p>
        <p>Telnet is designed for remote connectivity, and it establishes connections between a remote endpoint and a host machine to enable a remote session.</p>
        <p>Transmission Control Protocol:</p>
        <p>TCP is the other half of TCP/IP and arranges packets in order so IP can deliver them.</p>
        <p>User Datagram Protocol:</p>
        <p>UDP is an alternative to TCP and works with IP to transmit time-sensitive data. UDP enables low-latency data transmissions between internet applications, so this protocol is ideal for voice over IP or other audio or video requirements.</p>
