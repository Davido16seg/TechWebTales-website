        <h2>The Evolution Of The Web From Web 1.0 to 4.0</h2>
        <p>World Wide Web 1.0:</p>
        <p>Web 1.0 was the first implementation of the web and lasted from 1989 to roughly 2005. At the time, according to its creator, the World Wide Web was a “read-only” network. It provided very little interaction of sharing information together, but there was no real opportunity to interact with the site. “Google’s great-grandfather”, created by Martjin Koster at CERN in 1993, Aliweb was the world’s first search engine.</p>
        <p>World Wide Web 2.0:</p>
        <p>Web 2.0 is a whole new different generation of the web. Dale Dougherly defined it as the read-write web. Web 2.0 sites allowed for gathering and management of global groups with common interests, and the medium offered social interaction. Client-side, or browser, technologies used in its development included Ajax and JavaScript frameworks, using these designers can make pages function like desktop applications.</p>
        <p>World Wide Web 3.0 – Internet of today (probably tomorrow, too):</p>
        <p>Is the third generation of web services for websites and applications that focuses on using machine understanding of data to provide a data-driven and semantic web. The ultimate goal of Web 3.0 is to create more intelligent, connected and open websites. It hasn’t been really implemented yet, so it doesn’t have a solid definition. The technologies that some believe will create and ultimately define Web 3.0 are now being developed. Examples of how it is already impacting technology include Smart home devices and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
        <p>World Wide Web 4.0:</p>
        <p>While not-so-reliable sources of futurists and home edition visionaries report that we are already in full cyberpunk and Web 4.0. According to the 2017 publication Concept and Dimensions of Web 4.0, Web 4.0 is a new evolution of the networking paradigm based on multiple models, technologies, and social relationships. It is to create what is described as a symbiotic web – the boundary between human and machine will blur.</p>
