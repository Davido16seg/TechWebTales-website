        <h2>The Internet</h2>
        <p>Internet is a system architecture that has revolutionized communications and methods of commerce by allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect.</p>
        <h3>History Of The Internet:</h3>
        <p>Often referred to as a “network of networks”, the first practical schematics of it arrived in the early 1960s, when MIT’s J.C.R. Lickider popularized the idea of an “Intergalactic Network” of computers, but did not become visible to the general public until the early 1990s. By 2020, approximately 4.5 billion people, or more than half of the world’s population, were estimated to have access to the Internet. Important figures in its development include Robert W. Taylor, who led the development of the ARPANET (an early prototype of the internet), and Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technologies.</p>
        <p>Different services offered by the Internet include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) – is used to move files between computers attached to the internet.</li>
            <li>Information Retrieval Services – it is the procedure for gaining access to information/data stored on the internet.</li>
            <li>Web Services – allow information to be exchanged across web-applications.</li>
            <li>Network Management Services – aid in the prevention, analysis, diagnosis, and resolution of connection problems.</li>
        </ul>
